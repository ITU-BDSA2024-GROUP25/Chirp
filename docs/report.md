# Design and Architecture of _Chirp!_

## Domain model

Here comes a description of our domain model. 

![Illustration of the _Chirp!_ data model as UML class diagram.](images/DomainModel4.drawio.png)

## Architecture — In the small
Our chirp application uses onion architecture, as such our application Consists of three layers (projects),
The core layer, where our basic data types and interfaces are made. The infrastructure layer
Where most of our functions and interactions are defined. and the web layer, where everything is brough together with
dependency injections in our razor pages and application builder. 

Note: this 4 layered onion diagram is not 1:1 to the actual structure. Chirp.infrastructure covers both the
repository and services layer in our 3 layer onion. And we have some interfaces and DTOs that are from chirp.core
But as we use them for transport, and to set up our repository we find they fit better in the repository layer, than the domain layer. 

(short version: Note: the 4 layer onion diagram uses different abstractions of layers and are not 1:1 with the internal programs 3 layers)

## Architecture of deployed application

This is a visualization of our deployed program.

## User activities
![Illustration of the _Chirp!_ User journey](images/UserJourney.drawio.png)

This illustration shows a potential user journey through the chirp application. Before login every possible user journey is represented. After login the illustration only display some of the options a user has. All functionalities are addressed at some point in the journey, but the illustration would become unreadable if it showed every possible way the user can go. For instance, it is both possible to logout and access the public timeline, no matter where the user is, so there would be a lot of crossing arrows.

## Sequence of functionality/calls trough _Chirp!_
![Illustration of the _Chirp!_ Sequence Diagram](diagrams/SequenceDiagram.png)

The illustration shows the sequence of events happening when the user opens the application.This seqeunce diagram is made relatively high-level focusing on important sequences, meaning every single operation is not shown. For example, attributes such as Like-/DislikeAmount, IsFollowing, etc. are all retrieved as a part of the fetched objects from the request and shown accordingly. 

# Process

## Build, test, release, and deployment
For Chirp! we utilize three main github workflows. The first is an automated build and test workflow that attempts to build any commit or pull request.
It also runs our basic unit and integration tests, the more advanced test suite is not automated. For azure we have a standard azure deployment workflow with a minor change:
we have added an optional dispatch, and limited what triggers the workflow. As redeploying azure on trivial changes result in extensive downtime.
Our final Workflow "chirpflow" creates a release on versions with tags matching ```v.*.*.*``` this is mostly used for punctiating feature implementations. The releases 
contains the program compiled for windows, linux, osx, and arm-64.

Build and test: very usefull, used to see if a pull request actually passes the tests!
Does not run our most advanced tests. ( could mention that due to the lateish introduction of tools like playwright
we did not quite find the expertise and time to justify not running these tests locally. with out small team it's
quite easy to get someone else to hop on the branch and run the test suite before a merge) But could defenetly be improved
by letting it know our secrets and setting playwright up. (though the playwright tests break on UI changes, and that's not really an incompatiblilty)


AzureDeploy: this one is generated by azure, it is modified to build the app from core outward, as azure has had some disagreements with the applications onion architecture. We also limited when it runs as a modification.
Extremly usefull. especially as the onion architecture disallows manual terminal deployment the way we did prior to the refactoring.

chirpflow: This workflow is not used frequently as it's for creating a release, this should be run for weekly evaluations, and major updates.

## Team work
### *** INSERT final picture of bord with unfinished tasks *** 
comment on the missing changes 

-- add comment on why playwrite does not run though workflows. 

### Introducing a new feature  
From the beginning the team agreed to, work together physically instead of remotely when ever possible, therfore a lot of task were undertaken using a combination of mob programming and co-authoring, this goes for tackling a new feature as well.

When presented with a new feature to implement, a team member creates a new issue on the project bord and adds appropriate acceptance criteria. If there is some confusion as to what that would be, the team member brings it to the team, discuss it, and create a plan for how to best approach the implementation. When a new feature is under development a team member moves it from the To-do list to the in progress list and assigns one or more members to the task.

When assigned to an issue, member(s) then create- and publish a new branch to work on the issue, occasionally creating sub-branches to try different approaches. Doing their best to keep to a GitHub Flow -style branching strategy.
When the acceptance criteria had been fulfilled, the member(s) working the branch - or someone else from the team, will then create a new sub-branch, to write the necessary test for the new methods and- or UI features.

Now the member(s) working on the issue creates a pull request to the branch, to merge it with main branch, and add a reviewer(s). Before another team member can merge preliminary workflow checks will be run, then if the new input passes workflow checks (see -- add ref to WF --) and test the reviewer can look at the code, reject if necessary, or complete the merge. The old branch can then be deleted.

## How to make _Chirp!_ work locally
Before attempting to run Chirp, ensure that dotnet 8 is installed on you PC.
For running the localhost version of the main program there are no other install requirements than this.

The program does however need two secrets to be present on your computer to work.
to add the secrets to your "chirp secrets storage" navigate your terminal to **"chirp/src/chirp.web/"** folder. 
and use the following commands from terminal:

``` dotnet user-secrets set "authentication:github:clientId" "SECRET-A" ```

and

``` dotnet user-secrets set "authentication:github:clientSecret" "SECRET-B ```

**Initializing the secret store should not be necessary. just in case though the command is "dotnet user-secrets init"**

These are our localhost secrets, and will enable github login in chirp. This is required, as an exception is triggered if the github secrets are missing.

Now chirp! should be ready to run.

The Program must be run from the **chirp/src/chirp.web/** folder.
Either ``` dotnet run ```  or ``` dotnet Watch ```  will work.




## How to run test suite locally
There are two different test suits. 
First there is the tests that is primarily unit tests and don’t use the UI can be run from the Chirp folder by writing the command  ```dotnet test```

The tests that are separate to the unit tests is playwright tests and two integration tests, because they need to run on local host and therefore need to know the GitHub authorization secrets. This means that these tests can only be run locally.
Playwright must be installed to run the tests, and your computer need to know the secrets.

Step by step guide for playwright tests  
  1. Open a terminal. Navigate to the Chirp/src/Chirp.Web folder
  2. Run the command ```dotnet run```
  3. Open a new terminal. Navigate to the Chirp/test
  4. Run the command ```dotnet test```

## LLMs, ChatGPT, CoPilot, and others
During the project, ChatGPT was used sparingly and was used when we encountered problems or situations where we felt stuck and documentation sites such as StackOverflow deemed unhelpful. Another use case of ChatGPT was to avoid redundant manual tasks, such as generating colors for the dark mode stylesheet. 
The code segments developed with the help of an LLM have been clearly commented as such.  

ChatGPT was used in the following areas:
* CSS styling for dark mode and switch button.
* Database structuring and help with schema relations.
* Complex JavaScript features like "Maintain scroll" and "Switch button for color themes".
  
Generally, the use of LLMs sped up the project progress, however, in a few instances they provided wrong or buggy solutions which required extra time debugging.
