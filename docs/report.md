# Design and Architecture of _Chirp!_

## Domain model

![Illustration of the _Chirp!_ data model as UML class diagram.](images/DomainModelFINAL.drawio.png)

## Architecture â€” In the small
Our Chirp! application uses onion architecture, as such our application consists of three layers. The core layer is where our basic data types and interfaces are defined. 
The infrastructure layer is where most of our functions and interactions are implemented and the web layer is where everything is brought together with
dependency injections in our razor pages and application builder. 

Note: This 4 layered onion diagram is not 1:1 to the actual onion structure of the code. Chirp.Infrastructure covers both the
repository and services layer in our 4-layer onion diagram. For instance, we have Data Transfer Objects(DTOs) that are from Chirp.Core which we use 
for transportation between layers. We find they fit better in the repository layer than the domain layer in the diagram.

## User activities
![Illustration of the _Chirp!_ User journey](images/UserJourney.drawio.png)

This illustration shows a potential user's journey through the Chirp! application. Before login, every possible user journey is represented. 
After login, the illustration only displays the options linearly. All functionalities are addressed at some point in the journey,
but the illustration would become indecipherable if it showed every possible option at any time. For instance, it is possible to logout 
and access the public timeline, no matter where the user is.

## Sequence of functionality/calls through _Chirp!_
![Illustration of the _Chirp!_ Sequence Diagram](diagrams/SequenceDiagram.png)

The illustration shows the sequence of events happening when the user opens the application. This sequence diagram is made at a 
relatively high level of abstraction, and as such focuses on important sequences where every single operation is not shown. 
For example, attributes such as ```Like-/DislikeAmount```, ```IsFollowing```, etc. are all retrieved as a part of the fetched objects from the request and shown accordingly. 

# Process

## Build, test, release, and deployment

![Diagram of the three worklfows on the chirp github](images/workflows.png)

**Build-and-test** is an automated build and test workflow that attempts to build and test any commit or pull request. The workflow is used to see if a pull request passes the tests. 
This workflow exclusively runs backend tests.

**main_bdsagroup25chirprazor1** is generated by Azure and is modified to build the app starting with Chirp.Core followed 
by Chirp.Infrastructure and lastly Chirp.Web. This is because Azure has difficulties supporting the application's onion architecture. 
The onion architecture disallows manual terminal deployment. There are limits on what triggers the workflow 
as redeploying Azure on trivial changes results in extensive downtime. There is an optional dispatch to trigger the workflow manually.

**Chirpflow** is not used frequently as it is used for creating a GitHub release. Chirpflow is semi-manual as it requires version tags, matching ```v.*.*.*```, 
to be run and should be run for weekly evaluations and major updates. The releases contain the program compiled for Windows, Linux, OSX, and OSX arm-64.

## Team work
### *** INSERT final picture of bord with unfinished tasks *** 
comment on the missing changes 
( could mention that due to the lateish introduction of tools like playwright
we did not quite find the expertise and time to justify not running these tests locally. with out small team it's
quite easy to get someone else to hop on the branch and run the test suite before a merge) But could defenetly be improved
by letting it know our secrets and setting playwright up. (though the playwright tests break on UI changes, and that's not really an incompatiblilty)

-- add comment on why playwrite does not run though workflows. 

### Introducing a new feature  
From the beginning the team agreed to, work together physically instead of remotely when ever possible, therfore a lot of task were undertaken using a combination of mob programming and co-authoring, this goes for tackling a new feature as well.

When presented with a new feature to implement, a team member creates a new issue on the project bord and adds appropriate acceptance criteria. If there is some confusion as to what that would be, the team member brings it to the team, discuss it, and create a plan for how to best approach the implementation. When a new feature is under development a team member moves it from the To-do list to the in progress list and assigns one or more members to the task.

When assigned to an issue, member(s) then create- and publish a new branch to work on the issue, occasionally creating sub-branches to try different approaches. Doing their best to keep to a GitHub Flow -style branching strategy.
When the acceptance criteria had been fulfilled, the member(s) working the branch - or someone else from the team, will then create a new sub-branch, to write the necessary test for the new methods and- or UI features.

Now the member(s) working on the issue creates a pull request to the branch, to merge it with main branch, and add a reviewer(s). Before another team member can merge preliminary workflow checks will be run, then if the new input passes workflow checks (see -- add ref to WF --) and test the reviewer can look at the code, reject if necessary, or complete the merge. The old branch can then be deleted.

## How to make _Chirp!_ work locally
Before attempting to run Chirp!, ensure that dotnet 8 is installed on your computer.
For the localhost version of the Chirp!, there are no other install requirements.

The program does however need two secrets present on your computer for it to run.
To add the secrets to your "secrets-storage" navigate your terminal to **"chirp/src/chirp.web/"** folder and 
use the following commands from the terminal:

``` dotnet user-secrets set "authentication:github:clientId" "SECRET-A" ```

and

``` dotnet user-secrets set "authentication:github:clientSecret" "SECRET-B ```

**Initializing the secret store should not be necessary. However, just in case the command is "dotnet user-secrets init"**

These are our localhost secrets and will enable GitHub login on Chirp!. This is required, as an exception is triggered if the GitHub secrets are missing.

Now Chirp! should be ready to run.

The Program must be run from the **chirp/src/chirp.web/** folder.
Either ``` dotnet run ```  or ``` dotnet Watch ```  will work.




## How to run the test suite locally
There are two different test suits. 
There are the backend tests that are primarily unit tests and do not use the UI. These tests can be run from the Chirp folder by running the command:  ```dotnet test```

There are also tests that are separate from the unit tests such as Playwright tests and front-end integration tests. These tests need to run on localhost with Playwright installed and secrets present on the computer.  

Step-by-step guide for front-end tests  
  1. Open a terminal. Navigate to the Chirp/src/Chirp.Web folder
  2. Run the command ```dotnet run```
  3. Open a new terminal. Navigate to the Chirp/test
  4. Run the command ```dotnet test```

## LLMs, ChatGPT, CoPilot, and others
During the project, ChatGPT was used sparingly when we encountered problems or situations where we felt stuck and documentation sites such as StackOverflow were deemed unhelpful. Another use case of ChatGPT was to avoid redundant manual tasks, such as generating colors for the dark mode stylesheet. 
The few code segments developed with the help of an LLM have been clearly commented as such.  

ChatGPT was used in the following areas:
* CSS styling for dark mode and switch button.
* Database structuring and help with schema relations.
* Complex JavaScript features like "Maintain scroll" and "Switch button for color themes".
  
Generally, the use of LLMs sped up the project's progress. However, in a few instances, they provided wrong or buggy solutions which required extra time debugging.
